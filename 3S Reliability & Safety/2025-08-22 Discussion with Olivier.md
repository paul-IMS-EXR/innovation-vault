Based on what I understood from the discussion with Olivier, it appears that the priority list is as follows:
1. **Weed Science:** It is important to study the distribution, co-occurrence and "structure" of the weeds that are of interest to us. Otherwise, we will not really understand how to "tune" different aspects of the system, such as the required sensitivity, nor how to evaluate the system finally. A more detailed understanding of the weeds is crucial.
   *Possible actions:* Identify the best actors with whom to work on the subject, create a list of priority of weeds and field crops to study, mount some form of collaboration (internship, thesis, etc.)
2. **Spot Spraying Ground-Truth:** What is it that we really want to spray and identify? How can we define the object of interest so that we can consider that we really detected something or not? This topic is, in a sense, closely related to the previous one. 
3. **User Evaluation Metrics:** Is it possible to define some form of "universal metrics for spot spraying"? How is it possible to consider that a system is better than other, or at least, has done its job? *cf.* Discussion with ISO that does not take into consideration the detection quality, but only the spraying characteristics (location and bandwidth).
4. **Decision-Making:** It is crucial to be able to provide guarantees on the quality of detection, but to do that we need to level-up on the previously presented topics.

## Introduction
Weeding, *i.e.* the task of managing the propagation of weeds in cultivated lands, is one of the oldest challenges in agriculture. Very early on, humans had discovered the danger that weeds can pose to the cultivated crops, since they are quite difficult to eradicate and can propagate quickly and compete with the crops -- sometimes completely suffocating them. This can have devastating consequences on yields and the farmers' revenues.

A large number of weeding approaches have been used over time. Chemical weeding, which consists of eradicating weeds using chemical herbicide, is one of the most recent approaches over the history of agriculture REFRX. It is also one of the most effective methods REFRX. However, it has a number of negative consequences, which have pushed practitioners and agricultural technologists to look for alternative approaches. Some of these alternatives are modern adaptations of old methods, while others are truly novel technologies in the domain of weeding.

In this report, we will look at different alternatives to chemical weeding, particularly in the context of *robotic precision weeding*. The report will be based on a number of scientific articles studied, in addition to a review of commercially-available solutions, and a review of published patents.

## Why Look for Alternatives?
A valid question that may asked is why we need to look for alternative weeding approaches to chemical herbicides if they seem to be the most effective solution. A number of different reasons stand out after reviewing the relevant literature:

1. It is clear that chemical herbicides have negative effects on the health of the soil and water resources, which can render the land unusable for agriculture on the long term REFRX. Furthermore, these chemicals can also negatively affect the crops, and other living organisms in the field, effectively impacting the whole ecosystem REFRX. In turn, the effect of these herbicides reaches human and animal consumers causing potentially important danger to their health REFRX. While site-specific precision chemical spraying (as proposed by systems like 3S) can contribute to alleviating these shortcomings, it cannot completely remove the negative side-effects of chemicals.
2. Applying chemical herbicides over large stretches of land and over multiple seasons can help weeds develop what we call "herbicide-resistance" REFRX. Indeed, weeds can (and many have already) developed "immunity" against a number of chemical herbicides. This greatly reduces the chemical's effect on them, and in some cases completely removes it. This means that we either need to develop new chemical products to kill certain weeds (which is already what is being done), or look for alternative weeding approaches towards which the weeds cannot develop any form of resistance (more on that later).
3. With the strict rules and regulations being imposed on the usage of chemical products in agriculture -- especially in the EU -- it is becoming more and more difficult for farmers to rely on these "good old" chemicals to fight weeds REFRX. Alternative, more "eco-friendly" approaches may be the future of weeding on the long term.
4. While chemical precision spraying (like the one proposed by 3S) may be efficient for intensive farming, it is surely not adapted to "softer" forms of agriculture -- and surely impossible to be deployed in organic ("bio") farms. However, there is a growing preference in the market -- especially in the EU -- towards organic products REFRX. Organic farmers also appear to be willing to deploy robotic solutions in their fields REFRX: can alternative weeding methods open up this new market?

In the next section, we will present different alternative weeding methods, with a special focus on *robotic solutions*. For each method, we will present its potential benefits and also its shortcomings. 
### Weeding Approaches
Generally, weeding methods are classified based on their mode of action on the weeds or their method of application. While most of the following methods can be applied "manually", that is, by a human traversing the field and applying the weeding method, it is important to note that manual weeding is mostly inefficient for field crops over large surfaces. Therefore, we will mostly focus on methods that are already (or may still be) automated in one way or another.

#### Biological Weeding
This method consists of using biological agents, such as animals, to get rid of weeds. A good example is the deployment of insects that will attack only a specific species of plant (the weeds) without harming the cultivated species REFRX. Alternatively, the deployment of mammals such as goats or sheep that would only eat the weeds without attacking the cultivated crop REFRX. An important problem with these methods is the difficulty associated to controlling the behavior of the deployed animals: it is not easy to tell a goat to eat *only* the weeds without eating touching the nearby potatoes.

#### Mechanical Weeding
Mechanical weed control consists of the usage of mechanical tools to directly damage the weeds. In general, there are three ways that mechanical weeding acts on the weeds: (1) cutting, (2) uprooting, and (3) burying. Cutting targets the weed tissues, particularly in young seedlings, which would lead to the exhaustion of the plant's reserves and their eventual death. Uprooting consist of either exposing the weed's roots to the external environment, or completely detaching the weed from the soil. This would lead to their withering and eventual death. Burying is generally used only in certain types of crops, such as rice fields, whereby the field is puddled before the plantation of rice which would lead to burying most of the weeds.

##### Pros
The most important benefit of mechanical weeding is perhaps its "organic-friendly" nature. Indeed, mechanical approaches may be considered the direct extension of manual weeding through the usage of tools.

Furthermore, an important positive aspect of mechanical weeding, in the words of Greenfield Robotics' founder Clint Brauer, is that "a weed cannot develop resistance to a blade" REFRX. Mechanical approaches are "aggressive."

##### Cons
While looking attractive, mechanical weeding suffers from a number of shortcomings:

1. The effectiveness of mechanical approaches is highly dependent on weather and soil conditions, as well as the time of operation REFRX. Moreover, some mechanical approaches may have counter-productive results. For example, soil tilling methods that aim at destroying inter-row weeds may actually lead to burying their seeds in the soil thus leading to their re-emergence later on. Indeed, the "cleanliness" of mechanical approaches (in the sense of how completely they eradicate any trace of the weed) is perhaps their greatest shortcoming.
2. On the long term, mechanical weeding can have negative effects on the health of the soil as some mechanical operations such as tilling and uprooting can "tire" the soil. 
3. Generally, mechanical weeding can be useful for inter-row weeds. These are the weeds that grow between the rows of crops and are thus clearly separated by them, which makes mechanical operations easier. However, for intra-row weeds, which are growing among the crops, mechanical weeding is generally inefficient REFRX. Nonetheless, certain innovative mechanical weeding approaches have been developed to deal with some of these situations REFRX.
4. In continuation of the previous point, attacking the intra-row weeds that are close to the cultivated crops can actually damage the latter. For example, uprooting weed roots may cause damage to the crops' roots too, or cutting the weeds with sharp tools may also damage crop tissues.
5. Possibly a negative point is the large diversity of mechanical tools available for different modes of actions on different weeds. Unlike chemical approaches, where the same physical system can be used to spray different types of chemical products that are adapted to the weeds at hand (or better, that have general-purpose impact), it seems that different types of weeds, planting patterns and types of soil require different mechanical tools.

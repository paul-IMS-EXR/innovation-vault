## Introduction
Weeding, *i.e.* the task of managing the propagation of weeds in cultivated lands, is one of the oldest challenges in agriculture. Very early on, humans had discovered the danger that weeds can pose to the cultivated crops, since they are quite difficult to eradicate and can propagate quickly and compete with the crops -- sometimes completely suffocating them. This can have devastating consequences on yields and the farmers' revenues.

A large number of weeding approaches have been used over time. Chemical weeding, which consists of eradicating weeds using chemical herbicide, is one of the most recent approaches over the history of agriculture REFRX. It is also one of the most effective methods REFRX. However, it has a number of negative consequences, which have pushed practitioners and agricultural technologists to look for alternative approaches. Some of these alternatives are modern adaptations of old methods, while others are truly novel technologies in the domain of weeding.

In this report, we will look at different alternatives to chemical weeding, particularly in the context of *robotic precision weeding*. The report will be based on a number of scientific articles studied, in addition to a review of commercially-available solutions, and a review of published patents.

## Why Look for Alternatives?
A valid question that may asked is why we need to look for alternative weeding approaches to chemical herbicides if they seem to be the most effective solution. A number of different reasons stand out after reviewing the relevant literature:

1. It is clear that chemical herbicides have negative effects on the health of the soil and water resources, which can render the land unusable for agriculture on the long term REFRX. Furthermore, these chemicals can also negatively affect the crops, and other living organisms in the field, effectively impacting the whole ecosystem REFRX. In turn, the effect of these herbicides reaches human and animal consumers causing potentially important danger to their health REFRX. While site-specific precision chemical spraying (as proposed by systems like 3S) can contribute to alleviating these shortcomings, it cannot completely remove the negative side-effects of chemicals.
2. Applying chemical herbicides over large stretches of land and over multiple seasons can help weeds develop what we call "herbicide-resistance" REFRX. Indeed, weeds can (and many have already) developed "immunity" against a number of chemical herbicides. This greatly reduces the chemical's effect on them, and in some cases completely removes it. This means that we either need to develop new chemical products to kill certain weeds (which is already what is being done), or look for alternative weeding approaches towards which the weeds cannot develop any form of resistance (more on that later).
3. With the strict rules and regulations being imposed on the usage of chemical products in agriculture -- especially in the EU -- it is becoming more and more difficult for farmers to rely on these "good old" chemicals to fight weeds REFRX. Alternative, more "eco-friendly" approaches may be the future of weeding on the long term.
4. While chemical precision spraying (like the one proposed by 3S) may be efficient for intensive farming, it is surely not adapted to "softer" forms of agriculture -- and surely impossible to be deployed in organic ("bio") farms. However, there is a growing preference in the market -- especially in the EU -- towards organic products REFRX. Organic farmers also appear to be willing to deploy robotic solutions in their fields REFRX: can alternative weeding methods open up this new market?

In the next section, we will present different alternative weeding methods, with a special focus on *robotic solutions*. For each method, we will present its potential benefits and also its shortcomings. 
### Weeding Approaches
Generally, weeding methods are classified based on their mode of action on the weeds or their method of application. While most of the following methods can be applied "manually", that is, by a human traversing the field and applying the weeding method, it is important to note that manual weeding is mostly inefficient for field crops over large surfaces. Therefore, we will mostly focus on methods that are already (or may still be) automated in one way or another.

#### Biological Weeding
This method consists of using biological agents, such as animals, to get rid of weeds. A good example is the deployment of insects that will attack only a specific species of plant (the weeds) without harming the cultivated species REFRX. Alternatively, the deployment of mammals such as goats or sheep that would only eat the weeds without attacking the cultivated crop REFRX. An important problem with these methods is the difficulty associated to controlling the behavior of the deployed animals: it is not easy to tell a goat to eat *only* the weeds without eating touching the nearby potatoes.

#### Mechanical Weeding
Mechanical weed control consists of the usage of mechanical tools to directly damage the weeds. In general, there are three ways that mechanical weeding acts on the weeds: (1) cutting, (2) uprooting, and (3) burying. Cutting targets the weed tissues, particularly in young seedlings, which would lead to the exhaustion of the plant's reserves and their eventual death. Uprooting consist of either exposing the weed's roots to the external environment, or completely detaching the weed from the soil. This would lead to their withering and eventual death. Burying is generally used only in certain types of crops, such as rice fields, whereby the field is puddled before the plantation of rice which would lead to burying most of the weeds.

##### Pros
The most important benefit of mechanical weeding is perhaps its "organic-friendly" nature. Indeed, mechanical approaches may be considered the direct extension of manual weeding through the usage of tools.

Furthermore, an important positive aspect of mechanical weeding, in the words of Greenfield Robotics' founder Clint Brauer, is that "a weed cannot develop resistance to a blade" REFRX. Mechanical approaches are "aggressive."

##### Cons
While looking attractive, mechanical weeding suffers from a number of shortcomings:

1. The effectiveness of mechanical approaches is highly dependent on weather and soil conditions, as well as the time of operation REFRX. Moreover, some mechanical approaches may have counter-productive results. For example, soil tilling methods that aim at destroying inter-row weeds may actually lead to burying their seeds in the soil thus leading to their re-emergence later on. Indeed, the "cleanliness" of mechanical approaches (in the sense of how completely they eradicate any trace of the weed) is perhaps their greatest shortcoming.
2. On the long term, mechanical weeding can have negative effects on the health of the soil as some mechanical operations such as tilling and uprooting can "tire" the soil. 
3. Generally, mechanical weeding can be useful for inter-row weeds. These are the weeds that grow between the rows of crops and are thus clearly separated by them, which makes mechanical operations easier. However, for intra-row weeds, which are growing among the crops, mechanical weeding is generally inefficient REFRX. Nonetheless, certain innovative mechanical weeding approaches have been developed to deal with some of these situations REFRX.
4. In continuation of the previous point, attacking the intra-row weeds that are close to the cultivated crops can actually damage the latter. For example, uprooting weed roots may cause damage to the crops' roots too, or cutting the weeds with sharp tools may also damage crop tissues.
5. Possibly a negative point is the large diversity of mechanical tools available for different modes of actions on different weeds. Unlike chemical approaches, where the same physical system can be used to spray different types of chemical products that are adapted to the weeds at hand (or better, that have general-purpose impact), it seems that different types of weeds, planting patterns and types of soil require different mechanical tools.

### Thermal Weeding
Thermal weeding are used in a number of different agrosystems, particularly in organic agriculture. There are multiple thermal weeding approaches that we will present in more detail shortly. All of these methods have basically the same mode of action which consists of **causing a severe heat wave to the weeds** which would result in an **important damage to the plant tissues via membrane rupture**. This disrupts the physiological functioning of the plants by protein denaturation and enzyme deactivation, which in term would lead to the death of the weeds REFRX. 

We will now discuss the most commonly used thermal weeding approaches.

##### Flame Weeding
Flaming is the most common method of thermal weeding. It is important to clarify a widely held misconception: *flaming does not aim at igniting the plant tissues* (that is, turning them to ashes), but actually to expose them to an intense heat wave which would cause the rupturing of plant cells REFRX. As such, although exposure to flames may result in igniting certain plants, it is not really the primary aim of the method. 

A previous study have shown that a temperature exposure between **50 degrees Celsius for around 650 ms to 95 degrees Celsius for around 130 ms is necessary to kill weeds** REFRX. For flaming to be effective, it should be applied in such a way as to **raise the plant tissue temperature to at least 70 to 100 degrees Celsius** REFRX. 

The effectiveness of flame weeding depends on a number of factors, in particular:
- **Weed species:** certain types of weeds such as grasses have protected growing points and are thus more tolerant to flaming. Weeds that have unprotected growing points and sensitive leaves are more susceptible to flames REFRX.
- **Growth stage:** younger weeds which have smaller leaves and less biomass are easier to control with flames than bigger weeds which would require higher temperatures and longer exposure times. 
- **Moisture levels:** water act as an insulation for the leaves, which reduces the effectiveness of flaming. Flame weeding is thus more easily applied under relatively dry conditions. **However, it is important to take the relatively important risk of fires when applying this weeding approach.** "For example, flame methods are not considered as a reliable option in countries like Australia, as these provide unacceptable fire risks and are unsuitable for urban conditions" REFRX. 

The creation of the intense flame required for weeding is usually done using **liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)**, or **propane**, although **hydrogen** is being studied as a more renewable alternative REFRX.

**Pros**
In comparison to other weeding approaches, in particular chemical herbicides, flaming can present some advantages:
1. Unlike chemicals, **it does not have any residual impact on the plants, soil, air (questionable) and water**. In fact, the plant "residuals" caused after the disintegration of the weeds can even be useful as rich nutrients to the soil.
2. When applied on weeds that are not very close to the plants, we can say that it has **no drift hazard**, and in all cases **does not present the risk of carryover from one season to the next** (as is the case with chemical herbicides).
3. In comparison to mechanical approaches, it results in **much less soil disturbance**, which is important to maintain the health of the soil. 
4. As an indirect result, flaming can actually contribute to controlling pathogens and insects REFRX.

**Cons**
On the other hand, flaming presents important disadvantages mostly in terms of safety and the environment:
- **Cost:** Flame weeders are generally more costly than herbicide sprayers.
- **Low application speed:** Due to the exposure time required for the flames to increase the heat of the weed's tissue up to a lethal temperature, the application speed is relatively low compared to sprayers. Furthermore, this speed is greatly influenced by other factors such as biomass, the weed species and the moisture level, as we have discussed previously.
- **Lack of crop selectivity:** This can be an advantage or a disadvantage. Unlike chemical approaches, whereby the chemical product can be customized to each weed and be harmless to plants, flames are not really selective. They can just as easily kill our cultivated crops as the weeds they are targeting. To be used with caution.
- **Safety issues:** The danger for fire propagation is always present when using flames. This is particularly dangerous in dry lands. **Moreover, the integration of flames on an autonomous robot that will work without supervision can greatly increase the risk of fire accidents.**
- **Not very environment-friendly:** The combustion of propane gas or diesel fuel required for producing the flames releases greenhouse gas CO2 in the atmosphere. It is estimated that **propane used at 60 kg per hectare produced 189 kg of CO2 per hectare** REFRX Ulloa 2011. These high energy requirements and the release of CO2 can be seen as important disadvantages.

#### Hot Water Weeding
Another thermal weeding approach, which is also based on the idea of thermally shocking the weeds in order to cause damage to their tissues is *hot water weeding.* "Hot water melts the membrane cuticle of the plant leaves and breaks down the plant cell structures, which makes the plant unable to retain moisture and dehydrate within few hours or days" REFRX. 

Generally, this technique has been used to treat weeds in cracks and driveways. So far, it is still unclear how effective it can be on large field crops. In all cases, it has shown its effectiveness in controlling both annual and perennial weeds, both germinating and already mature. Indeed, in some studies, it has shown results comparable to glyphosate treatment REFRX. It is important to note that most of the weeds actually regrow after non-chemical treatment. As such, multiple consecutive treatments are often required (mostly between 3 and 5) during the growing season to keep weeds under control REFRX Rask et al. 2013. Hot water treatment seems to be more effective on planophile leaved weeds rather than erectophile weeds (such as grass). 

Multiple factors influence the effectiveness of this method. These include the weed development stage, exposure time, droplets size, wetting agent, water temperature and daytime variation in thermal sensitivity and water flow. Other environmental factors such as air temperature, drought, and rainfall are hypothesized to also influence the effectiveness of such methods REFRX.

**Pros**
Hot water shares the same positive points as the previously presented methods in that it does not contaminate the underground water, soil and air like chemical spraying. Furthermore, it eliminates the risks of potential exposure of human and wildlife to pesticide residues. 

In addition, unlike flame weeding, hot water approaches do not present the risks of fire hazard and are generally safe.

**Cons**
Hot water weeding presents multiple negative points that make it really unattractive as a potential method for large field crops:
1. Hot water shares one of the main negative points as chemical herbicides: it is a broad-spectrum biocide. This means that it is a general killer of living things. As such, it does not only target the weeds, but may also kill the field crops in case of exposure, or other beneficial soil organisms like fungi and bacteria that contribute positively to crop growth REFRX.
2. A crucial point to take into consideration is that hot water weeding is not cost-effective nor energy-efficient for large-scale applications, particularly in comparison to other thermal methods such as propane flaming or infrared heat REFRX. 

#### Hot Foam Weeding
A more effective upgrade to hot water weeding is hot foam.  It is an approach that was first patented in 1995 and consists of adding biodegradable foaming agents to hot water REFRX Rajammanan 1996 patent. The resulting foam has little impact on the environment and human health. 

"The foam insulates the weeds from the surrounding air and increases the energy transfer to the plants, thus lowering the dose of hot water required and increasing efficiency" REFRX Martelloni 2021 Cederlund 2016. 

This approach has been used for treating weeds on hard surfaces, such as streets, pavements and railways. There is very little research showing the usage of hot foam weeding in open fields, with the exception of two new articles REFRX (appeared 2024-2025) by a research group in Greece who studied the application of hot foam in olive groves REFRX, vineyards, spinach and onion fields REFRX. In the case of weeding between olive trees, hot foam proved to be as effective as glyphosate (!) REFRX. These results imply that hot foam can be an eco-friendly alternative to chemical herbicides in some conditions.

In terms of energy efficiency, REFRX have shown that hot foam requires 2.3 to 2.75 less water and energy to achieve the same level of weed control as hot water.

**Pros**
Hot foam appears to be an effective alternative to chemical herbicides. It shares the positive points of hot water weeding, with the addition of being more cost and energy effective. Moreover, it has demonstrated important performance in a number of field applications -- although this is yet to be studied in more details. 

In addition, hot foam can be coupled with mechanical weeding to achieve even better weed control performances.

**Cons**
While providing improvements to some of the shortcomings of hot water weeding, hot foam still suffers from the need for high energy required for heating the water REFRX.

### Laser Weeding
One of the most technologically advanced weeding approaches is laser weeding. This approach relies on the emission of concentrated high-energy laser ("light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation") beams. Depending on the laser type, this high energy is either absorbed by the plant surface -- which causes direct damage to the plant's tissues -- or can traverse its epidermis and reach the water stored in the plant which would cause its heating and its eventual withering and death REFRX. This mode of action has led some researchers to classify laser weeding approaches as thermal methods. However, we prefer to separate them from the previous methods because they present some distinct aspects that deserve to be emphasized.

#### Types of Lasers
There are three main categories of lasers used for a large variety of applications from sensing to cutting. The two main factors that distinguish them are the active medium and the range of emission wavelengths REFRX.

1. Diode laser: this category of lasers uses a semiconductor stimulated by an electric current as their active medium. They can produce laser beams with wavelengths ranging from ultraviolet (10 nm -- 400 nm) to infrared (700 nm -- 1 mm) radiation.
2. Fiber laser: these lasers can also be called "solid-state lasers" and use a doped glass as the active medium. They emit laser beams within the visible (400 nm -- 700 nm) and near-infrared (700 nm -- 1400 nm)  light spectrum.
3. CO2 laser: these types of laser use a mixture of gas (typically nitrogen, helium and CO2) as their active medium. They can emit beams that are in the far-infrared (15 µm -- 1 mm) light spectrum characterized by their higher penetrability.

#### Energy Requirements
A crucial component in laser weeding is the electrical energy required for stimulating the active medium that would emit the laser beam. While in fixed applications this electric energy is often harnessed from fixed electrical grids relatively easily, it becomes a bit more complicated to manage the required energy supply in mobile applications (such as autonomous tractors or robots). "A pivotal element contributing to the efficiency of field robots in this context is the ability to efficiently utilize the electric energy in batteries or generated onboard the machine through the consumption of other fuels" REFRX. The choice of the laser wavelength thus becomes a crucial decision when designing a laser weeding apparatus. 

It is known that shorter wavelengths have higher energy and thus require higher energy to be emitted. REFRX Kaierle at al., conducted an extensive comparative study of the energy demands of different laser weeding methods on the Amaranthus retroflexes (redroot pigweed) weed species. The found that the overall energy demand was minimized when employing a wavelength of 10.6 µm using a CO2 laser. On the other hand, shorter wavelengths of 1.908 µm, 940 nm, and 532 nm corresponding to solid-state, fiber and diode lasers respectively, demanded much higher doses of energy per weed for effective control (230 J, 237 J, and 1400 J, respectively).

It is important to keep in mind that multiple factors influence the energy requirements to achieve lethal damage on the weed (which would in turn influence the choice of the wavelength and the laser technology to be used) REFRX Marx et al. Such factors are (1) weed species, (2) plant growth stage, (3) laser spot position and its area, (4) the applied laser energy, etc. As expected, small weeds (particularly at early growth stages) are much more efficient to treat using laser approaches as they require much less energy. 

**Pros**
Laser weeding shares many of the positive points presented for the other methods, while proposing new advantages:
1. High precision: unlike previous methods, like mechanical weeding or thermal methods, laser weeding provides very high precision of application -- even more so than precision chemical spraying. Even though precision spraying systems, such as 3S, are becoming more and more precise, they still suffer from typical physical constraints such as wind drift or a relatively large spraying radius, which means that some chemical deposits will inevitably fall on field crops and the soil in all cases. Laser beams, however, with their small concentrated spot area can be guided with high precision to attack only the required points for killing the weeds.
2. Minimal impact on soil health: unlike chemical approaches, which pollute the soil, and mechanical methods, which tire the soil, laser weeding has very minimal impact on the soil condition. While it may result in the heating of small areas of the soil through exposure, this heating is often not high nor long enough to cause real damage to the organisms living in it REFRX.
3. Lower energy requirements: laser weeding may need, in certain applications, less energy than mechanical weeding and surely than flaming. This gain in energy efficiency is particularly due to the precision gain discussed in point 1. previously: the laser can be guided to be activated only where it really needs to be REFRX Kaierle. In all cases, chemical weeding still seems to be the champion in terms of energy requirements.

**Cons**
We may be fascinated by laser weeding and its big potential. However, it still presents important shortcomings:
1. Fire hazard: the high energy generated by the lasers can lead to heat production when in contact with surfaces. "This heat can pose a fire hazard, particularly in fields containing dry materials like straw, leaves, or other organic matter" REFRX. This means that laser weeding problems require continuous surveillance -- which can be problematic when we are trying to develop a fully-autonomous weeding system.
2. Potential health hazard to humans and animals: "exposure to laser light can cause irreversible damage, including blindness" REFRX. Indeed, visible and near-infrared lasers can be a serious threat to the retina, while ultraviolet and far-infrared spectrum ranges can harm the cornea or lens. As such, safety measures should be particularly taken into consideration when developing and deploying such systems. Furthermore, "precautions must be taken to prevent beams of laser from escaping the working area due to reflections from stones, sand, or other reflective items." This can be done using screens and curtains such as the one we can see on Carbon Robotics systems FIGREFRX.
3. Dwell time and weeding speed: it is often the case that a laser needs to be projected for a relatively long time (between 0.5 to 1.5 seconds) for it to really harm a plant. This means that the tractor system using a laser weeding system cannot move as fast as a system spraying chemicals (reported speeds between 3 and 6 km/h, in comparison to 6 to 40 km/h for chemical sprayers). 
4. Higher technical cost: I would like to clarify that this point is due to my own observation and may not be true. In all cases, it seems that developing -- and especially optimizing -- laser systems requires much higher technical knowledge than other approaches such as mechanical or thermal approaches.

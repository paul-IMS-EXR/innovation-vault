## Lytridis & Pachidis (2024), *AgriEngineering*.

- Non-chemical approaches involve mainly mechanical and laser solutions.
- There's a large variety of mechanical approaches:
	- Flywheel stamping tool (?)
	- Rotating blade
	- Screw-type wheels (?)
	- Flail-deck weeding (?)
	- Hoe
	- Tine (check McCool's article for more details on these two methods)
- Some of the solutions are actually mounted on some form of arms that have > 1 degrees of freedom (DOF)

## Commercial websites

- **Greenfield Robotics (US):** "chemical-free food at scale". Probably use a battery-based robot for physically uprooting weeds. https://www.greenfieldincorporated.com
	- First passage with a drone to map the field, then fleet of lightweight robots goes around cutting weeds with rotating blades while avoiding the crops.
- **FarmDroid D20 (Denmark):** Multipurpose seed-weed-spray robot powered by solar panels. https://farmdroid.com/fr/products/mechanical-weeding-system/
	- Mechanical weeding at multiple scales: in-row using weeding knives, close to rows using cutting discs, or using weeding wires.
- **WeedSpider by SeedSpider (US & NZ):** Fully automated weeding and thinning robot using a sort of mechanical tilling. https://seedspider.com/products/weedspider/
	- Lidar technology creates real-time 3D map of the soil (taking soil depth into consideration) then the weeding mechanism moves accordingly by avoiding plants and keeping the tilling at the specified soil depth.
	- Metrics on their websites: 95% reduction in labor cost, up to 28 acres per day, up to 3.5 acres per hour. Not clear where the numbers come from.

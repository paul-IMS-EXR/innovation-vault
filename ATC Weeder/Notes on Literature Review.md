- Non-chemical approaches involve mainly mechanical and laser solutions.
- There's a large variety of mechanical approaches:
	- Flywheel stamping tool (?)
	- Rotating blade
	- Screw-type wheels (?)
	- Flail-deck weeding (?)
	- Hoe
	- Tine (check McCool's article for more details on these two methods)
- Some of the solutions are actually mounted on some form of arms that have > 1 degrees of freedom (DOF).

### Mechanical Weeding

From Bloomer *et al.* (2024), *New Zealand Journal of Agricultural Robotics*: 
- Not very efficient and potentially damages the soil: **"Cultivation by ploughing, discing, harrows, tines, or hoes to separate, uproot or bury weeds also damages soil structure and may have a high labour and energy cost."**
- Not only do we damage the soil, but can actually contribute to dispersing the weed seeds further and more, and actually help them spread: **"The disturbance of soil may disperse and bury seed, induce dormancy and promote additional weed germination."**
- **If we want to better preserve the soil, then we can use "non-soil engaging methods"** which rely on destroying the parts of the weeds that are above ground. This can be done by "mowing, abrasion, crushing, or seed destruction at harvest." The problem, however, is the following: **"Removing above-ground parts may not kill all weeds but can reduce competition and prevent seeding."**

### Thermal Weeding

From Bloomer *et al.* (2024), *New Zealand Journal of Agricultural Robotics*: 
- **"Thermal controls include the use of flame, hot air, steam, hot water, radiation, and electrothermal equipment."**
- There are also other, more recent thermal approaches: **"microwaves, ultraviolet light, laser pyrolysis and high-intensity light are alternative thermal technologies."** 
- **Pros:** can control weeds without mechanical contact and can operate in the presence of high crop or mulch residues.
- **Cons:** "**Flame and high-energy electric or laser systems have a high fire risk**, especially in dry organic residue environments. **For autonomous systems with no human observer in the field to respond, this is particularly important.**"
- It seems to me that thermal methods may probably require high levels of energy, which may vary indeed depending on the weeds treated and have a high variability of efficacy.

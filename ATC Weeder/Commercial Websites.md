- **Greenfield Robotics (US):** "chemical-free food at scale". Probably use a battery-based robot for physically uprooting weeds.

	- First passage with a drone to map the field, then fleet of lightweight robots goes around cutting weeds with rotating blades while avoiding the crops.
- **FarmDroid D20 (Denmark):** Multipurpose seed-weed-spray robot powered by solar panels. 
	- [https://farmdroid.com/fr/products/mechanical-weeding-system/](https://farmdroid.com/fr/products/mechanical-weeding-system/)
	- Mechanical weeding at multiple scales: in-row using weeding knives, close to rows using cutting discs, or using weeding wires.
- **WeedSpider by SeedSpider (US & NZ):** Fully automated weeding and thinning robot using a sort of mechanical tilling procedure (patented).

	- Lidar technology creates real-time 3D map of the soil (taking soil depth into consideration) then the weeding mechanism moves accordingly by avoiding plants and keeping the tilling at the specified soil depth.
	- Metrics on their websites: 95% reduction in labor cost, up to 28 acres per day, up to 3.5 acres per hour. Not clear where the numbers come from.
- **Carbon Robotics (US):** *Laser Weeder*, precision laser weeding using computer vision and deep learning. Already at version 2 of the system.

	- Tractor advances (rather slowly) when weeds are still in early stage. Cameras and images detect the weeds which are beamed by a laser which leads to them taking fire then disintegrating over the following days. 
- **Verdant Robotics (US):** *SharpShooter*, Taking "precision spraying" to a new level really by creating a system that actually aims at the weed detected and sprays only on it instead of spraying on a large radius.

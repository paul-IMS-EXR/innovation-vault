### Mechanical Weeding

From Bloomer *et al.* (2024), *New Zealand Journal of Agricultural Robotics*: 
- Not very efficient and potentially damages the soil: **"Cultivation by ploughing, discing, harrows, tines, or hoes to separate, uproot or bury weeds also damages soil structure and may have a high labour and energy cost."**
- Not only do we damage the soil, but can actually contribute to dispersing the weed seeds further and more, and actually help them spread: **"The disturbance of soil may disperse and bury seed, induce dormancy and promote additional weed germination."**
- **If we want to better preserve the soil, then we can use "non-soil engaging methods"** which rely on destroying the parts of the weeds that are above ground. This can be done by "mowing, abrasion, crushing, or seed destruction at harvest." The problem, however, is the following: **"Removing above-ground parts may not kill all weeds but can reduce competition and prevent seeding."**

### Thermal Weeding

From Bloomer *et al.* (2024), *New Zealand Journal of Agricultural Robotics*: 
- **"Thermal controls include the use of flame, hot air, steam, hot water, radiation, and electrothermal equipment."**
- There are also other, more recent thermal approaches: **"microwaves, ultraviolet light, laser pyrolysis and high-intensity light are alternative thermal technologies."** 
- **Pros:** can control weeds without mechanical contact and can operate in the presence of high crop or mulch residues.
- **Cons:** "**Flame and high-energy electric or laser systems have a high fire risk**, especially in dry organic residue environments. **For autonomous systems with no human observer in the field to respond, this is particularly important.**"
- It seems to me that thermal methods may probably require high levels of energy, which may vary indeed depending on the weeds treated and have a high variability of efficacy. 

### Electrical Weeding

From Bloomer *et al.* (2024), *New Zealand Journal of Agricultural Robotics*: 
- Electric weeding is a relatively old technology. Oldest patents date back to 1890s.
- **"The commercial electrical systems available today have high energy demands and are suited only to certain weed/crop scenarios."** 
- "Understanding of electro-impulse weeding is lacking in many areas, including requirements and mechanisms of plant destruction, the modes and safety of electrical equipment and optimum forms of electrodes."
- There are two approaches: continuous alternating current (AC) or high voltage impulses (DC). Apparently DC systems require less energy and less-bulky equipment, thus increasing work safety. 
- Important concept in weed control **lethal dose**: it is the dose that actually kills the weed. While in chemical herbicides it is often measured by the quantity of chemical product required to destroy the weed, in electrical weeding it refers to the electric energy required to cause irreversible tissue damage in a range of weeds.
- Judaev and Brenina (2008) note that weeds during flowering and beginning of fruit require more energy than at other stages.
- Rootwave: 18 kHz AC which uses 50 MJ/ha. Apparently very high-frequency electricity (18 kHz) is safer than usual 50 Hz frequencies or DC systems. (???)
- **"There are two main electric weeding technology categories: (1) continuous-contact high-energy systems and (2) pulsed-discharge low-energy systems."** 
- The weed may present no signs of being hit, but seems to die several days later.
- Can we apply a spot-electrical weeder? The problem is: as we advance and detect, do we have enough time to discharge enough electricity to kill the weed?
- Interesting video to understand how the pulsed current technique works: https://youtube.com/shorts/5WG22cdO5hE?si=0jQ5tRctN171yegv

### Energy Demands of Different Techniques
Perhaps the most important argument *against* the usage of alternative approaches to chemical spraying seems to be **the energy requirements** of the alternative techniques.

Energy is often measured by MJ/ha (megajoule per hectare) at a given density of plants. Usually the reference density of plants is taken at 5 plants/mÂ². Thus, this measures how much energy is required for one hectare.

As can be seen in the below tables, the energy requirements present very highly variable energy requirements, but in all cases appear to present less so using site-specific approaches.

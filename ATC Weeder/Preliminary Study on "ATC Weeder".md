## Introduction
Weeding, *i.e.* the task of managing the propagation of weeds in cultivated lands, is one of the oldest challenges in agriculture. Very early on, humans had discovered the danger that weeds can pose to the cultivated crops, since they are quite difficult to eradicate and can propagate quickly and compete with the crops -- sometimes completely suffocating them. This can have devastating consequences on yields and the farmers' revenues.

A large number of weeding approaches have been used over time. Chemical weeding, which consists of eradicating weeds using chemical herbicide, is one of the most recent approaches over the history of agriculture REFRX. It is also one of the most effective methods REFRX. However, it has a number of negative consequences, which have pushed practitioners and agricultural technologists to look for alternative approaches. Some of these alternatives are modern adaptations of old methods, while others are truly novel technologies in the domain of weeding.

In this report, we will look at different alternatives to chemical weeding, particularly in the context of *robotic precision weeding*. The report will be based on a number of scientific articles studied, in addition to a review of commercially-available solutions, and a review of published patents.

## Why Look for Alternatives?
A valid question that may asked is why we need to look for alternative weeding approaches to chemical herbicides if they seem to be the most effective solution. A number of different reasons stand out after reviewing the relevant literature:

1. It is clear that chemical herbicides have negative effects on the health of the soil and water resources, which can render the land unusable for agriculture on the long term REFRX. Furthermore, these chemicals can also negatively affect the crops, and other living organisms in the field, effectively impacting the whole ecosystem REFRX. In turn, the effect of these herbicides reaches human and animal consumers causing potentially important danger to their health REFRX. While site-specific precision chemical spraying (as proposed by systems like 3S) can contribute to alleviating these shortcomings, it cannot completely remove the negative side-effects of chemicals.
2. Applying chemical herbicides over large stretches of land and over multiple seasons can help weeds develop what we call "herbicide-resistance" REFRX. Indeed, weeds can (and many have already) developed "immunity" against a number of chemical herbicides. This greatly reduces the chemical's effect on them, and in some cases completely removes it. This means that we either need to develop new chemical products to kill certain weeds (which is already what is being done), or look for alternative weeding approaches towards which the weeds cannot develop any form of resistance (more on that later).
3. With the strict rules and regulations being imposed on the usage of chemical products in agriculture -- especially in the EU -- it is becoming more and more difficult for farmers to rely on these "good old" chemicals to fight weeds REFRX. Alternative, more "eco-friendly" approaches may be the future of weeding on the long term.
4. While chemical precision spraying (like the one proposed by 3S) may be efficient for intensive farming, it is surely not adapted to "softer" forms of agriculture -- and surely impossible to be deployed in organic ("bio") farms. However, there is a growing preference in the market -- especially in the EU -- towards organic products REFRX. Organic farmers also appear to be willing to deploy robotic solutions in their fields REFRX: can alternative weeding methods open up this new market?

In the next section, we will present different alternative weeding methods, with a special focus on *robotic solutions*. For each method, we will present its potential benefits and also its shortcomings. 
### Weeding Approaches
Broadly speaking, weeding methods have been usually categorized as such:

- **Manual weeding:** Perhaps the oldest method in this list. It consists of humans traversing the field looking for weeds and uprooting them manually or with the help of some tool.
- **Biological weeding:** This method consists of using biological entities, such as animals, to get rid of weeds. A good example is the deployment of some insects that will attack only a specific species of plant (the weed) without harming the cultivated species. Alternatively, the deployment of mammals such as goats or sheep in the field that would only eat the weeds without attacking the cultivated crop. An important problem with these methods is the difficulty associated to controlling the behavior of the deployed animals: it is not easy to tell a goat to only eat the weeds without eating the nearby potatoes.
